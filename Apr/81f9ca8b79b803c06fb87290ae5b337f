As of this month, Agrilinks is officially 10 years old. That’s a full decade of learning, connecting, knowledge-sharing and training. Over the last decade, we’ve hosted more than 24 theme months, 150 webinars and 3,800 blog posts covering everything from data systems to women’s empowerment. We’ve gained over 13,000 members in more than 50 countries. And the diversity of our community and content continues to grow. We want to thank each and every one of you for making Agrilinks what it is today. From our knowledgeable cast of food security experts around the world leading webinars and trainings, to our insightful writers providing detailed analysis and reporting, your work is critical and continues to inspire us every day. None of us can change the world alone, but together, the Agrilinks community is leading the way in agriculture-led food security through knowledge-sharing. So how can you get involved in celebrating with us this month? Here are a few suggestions: We asked 10 members to reflect on the last 10 years and what they see ahead in the next 10 years. We’ll be releasing blogs and videos of their responses every week. Follow our social media channels for updates to see when they become available throughout the month. Help celebrate with our social media toolkit, which includes graphics, sample posts, videos and more for you to share with your networks. This month, we will be hosting a webinar with expert food security specialists to discuss their perspectives on the past, present and future of agricultural development. How did we get here and what can we do to achieve a zero hunger future? We’ll be sharing a link to sign up for the webinar soon.  We are thrilled to be celebrating all of the work our community has done to make the world more food-secure over the last decade. This month, as we celebrate and reflect, we also continue to look forward to future research, collaborations and innovations in the next 10 years. There will certainly be challenges ahead, but the Agrilinks community will be here to meet them. Thank you again for all of your contributions, insights and passion in the fight against international food insecurity. Happy 10-year anniversary, Agrilinks!
