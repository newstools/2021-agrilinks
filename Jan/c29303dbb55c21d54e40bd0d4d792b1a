PRO-WASH is pleased to announce the release of the Pathogens Pathway Study for Children under two years old in Northwestern Kenya Request for Applications (RFA). The activity will fund one award under this RFA up to $200,000 USD for a study period of up to eight months beginning in early 2021. This request for applications (RFA) is designed to provide innovative, context-specific research on strategies for interrupting fecal-oral transmission and reduce overall environmental contamination for the Nawiri (Mercy Corps) Resilience Food Security Activity in Northwestern Kenya. The resulting strategy from this RFA will be critical in supporting implementing partners to be able to validate which transmission pathways are most important in the specific context of Turkana and Samburu and to begin the process of piloting potentially promising, multi-sectoral WASH interventions. Submissions are due by 5 PM ET on Friday, February 5, 2021. Applications (to include proposal and detailed budget) must be submitted electronically to prowash@savechildren.org.
