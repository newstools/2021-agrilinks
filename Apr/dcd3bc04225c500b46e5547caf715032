The Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Food Safety (FSIL) invites researchers at minority serving institutions (MSIs), as defined under part F of the Higher Education Act, 20 U.S. Code § 1067q, to submit proposals for research projects that support FSIL’s mission to reduce the burden of foodborne illness on individuals, households and communities through data-driven food safety policies and practices.         There is a three-stage application process to promote the formation of dynamic, complementary teams that can creatively address FSIL research priorities: Review panels will be comprised of the FSIL director and associate director, MSI partnerships liaison, advisory committee, technical experts and the USAID Agreement Officer’s Representative (AOR). FSIL expects to fund two proposals under this solicitation. FSIL is a five-year collaborative research program implemented by Purdue University (lead institution) and Cornell University. The program is funded by USAID as part of Feed the Future, the U.S. government’s global hunger and food security initiative. Learn more about recently funded food safety projects on the FSIL website.
