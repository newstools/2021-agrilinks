Facilitated by the Implementer-Led Design, Evidence, Analysis and Learning (IDEAL) activity, the Food Security COVID-19 Learning Event will create an opportunity for emergency and non-emergency practitioners of USAID/Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance-funded activities to: Pause and reflect on the lessons learned so far from implementing emergency and non-emergency food security activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Explore innovations and adaptations resulting from the response to a changing environment. Discuss the implications and applicability of lessons learned and adaptations across pandemic contexts to situations beyond COVID-19. Network with colleagues to establish and strengthen relationships for peer-to-peer collaboration and learning. The Food Security COVID-19 Learning Event will have a variety of session formats that allow for storytelling, collective problem-solving, cocreating and networking. IDEAL encourages implementing partners to submit to become presenters or facilitators for our different session formats. The deadline for submissions is Thursday, May 6, 2021 at 12 p.m. EST. To learn more about becoming a presenter/facilitator, visit our webpage.
