As part of the Agrilinks 10-year anniversary, we are celebrating with testimonials from some of our top users. Read on to hear from Meaghan Murphy, the chief of party for the Feed the Future Knowledge, Data, Learning and Training project. The following is a transcript of a 10-year anniversary video series. The full video can be played at the bottom of the page. Hi, my name is Meaghan Murphy. I’ve been working in the field of food security and agricultural development for over 15 years, and most recently I’m the chief of party for the Feed the Future Knowledge, Data, Learning and Training project that actually oversees the Agrilinks design and ongoing development. I’ve been a member of Agrilinks since the community began when the site launched 10 years ago. If I had to describe the Agrilinks community to someone that had never worked with the site before, I would say that it is a dynamic, evolving community of dedicated practitioners and that the site’s really evolved and continues to evolve with the priorities and changing themes and topics that are important to the food security and international development community. I’m really excited to continue to be a part of it and to see where the next 10 years take us. Happy 10-year anniversary, Agrilinks!
