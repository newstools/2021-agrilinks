At Land O'Lakes Venture37, we are all about learning: we make decisions based on evidence and we regularly learn and adapt. That is why we are so excited to celebrate with Agrilinks on their 10-year anniversary — it is one of our organization’s favorite platforms for learning and sharing with our peers. Here, we look back over the past decade and share three unexpected learnings we have made around resilience, and we look ahead to the next decade to share how those learnings are influencing our priorities and programming Women’s empowerment in agriculture is essential Private sector investments improve food safety and nutrition We are excited about what we have learned over the past 10 years and how we are adapting and building from those learnings for the next decade and beyond. We look forward to continuing to use Agrilinks as a resource to learn and share as we go!
