Roberta Lauretti-Bernhard, Food Enterprise Solutions' (FES') principal and director of programs, and a technical lead for Feed the Future Business Drivers for Food Safety (BD4FS), shared her food safety expertise in an interview with Marina Mayer of Food Logistics Magazine — a publication reaching over 26,000 global food and beverage supply chain executives. The article, "Providing Safe Food in an Unsafe World" (released April 2021), addresses challenges surrounding the modern-day concept of “food safety” that broadly encompasses people, planet and profits. In the interview, Lauretti-Bernhard noted that U.S. and international food businesses can benefit from the increasing global demand for safer food by investing in critical infrastructure, such as cold chain logistics. She emphasized, “…Now is the time for related food companies to look for opportunities, particularly in Africa, the up-and-coming global food basket.” With capacity building being a key objective for the USAID-funded BD4FS project, Lauretti-Bernhard highlighted that, “…One of our strategies is to work with companies to show how proper training can benefit their bottom line ... .” Youth and women entrepreneur involvement is also critical to the future of food safety, and BD4FS educates youth and women entrepreneurs as part of its capacity building strategy. BD4FS is funded by USAID and implemented by FES. Learn more about FES at www.foodsolutions.global.
