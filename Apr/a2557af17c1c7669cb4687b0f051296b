As part of the Agrilinks 10-year anniversary, we are celebrating with testimonials from some of our top users. Read on to hear from Kristin Davis, a senior research fellow in the Development Strategy and Governance Division at CGIAR. The following is a transcript of a 10-year anniversary video series, the full video can be played at the bottom of the page: Hi, my name is Kristin Davis. I’ve been working in agricultural development and extension for the last almost 29 years. And I’ve been a member of Agrilinks for the past 5 years. Agrilinks is a great resource for people working around the world in all things agriculture. There’s webinars, thematic materials, information about projects and activities, and blogs. As a member, you can also post your own content on Agrilinks. In running Feed the Future developing local extension capacity project over the last 5 years, Agrilinks was critical for our project in terms of providing a platform to share our work through webinars, blog, uploading our project material. Agrilinks has a huge reach, which really amplified our message and expanded our audience. I think that a couple of things really need to happen for the world to achieve food security in the next 10 years. First of all, people in agriculture need the tools and the capacities to help to transform the agri-food system. Secondly, information about both successes and failures needs to be shared. I think Agrilinks can help with this through providing a platform for capacity strengthening and sharing information about capacity strengthening. Agrilinks can also help to showcase advances in achieving food security. If I could describe the Agrilinks community in 1 word, it would be passionate. Happy 10-year anniversary, Agrilinks!
