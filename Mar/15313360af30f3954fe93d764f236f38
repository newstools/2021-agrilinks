The new Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Current and Emerging Threats in Crops (CETC) has been posted to grants.gov and can be found here. The closing date for applications is May 11, 2021. The CETC Innovation Lab will design, lead, and implement an applied research program focused on the control of current and emerging biotic threats to food security crops that the poor depend on. The program will also strengthen local research partners through capacity development while benefiting smallholder farmers and other beneficiaries of USAID assistance. The CETC Innovation Lab will serve as a resource to USAID Missions and their implementing partners in their efforts to overcome critical crop pest, weed and disease constraints facing their national food systems. The Innovation Lab is broadly expected to help recognize, build on and influence impact pathways from crop biotic threat protection research to development outcomes through partnerships with USAID Mission-supported programs, national partners, private companies, community-based organizations, and other donors and their programs. Eligibility is restricted to Title XII U.S. universities and other eligible institutions. Please direct all questions to: Leah Leach, lleach@usaid.gov. Learn more and apply here.
