Opportunity type: Cracking the Nut 2021: Proposal to Present. Application deadline: Friday, May 14, 2021. For the first time, the Cracking the Nut Conference will adopt a fully-virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary topic for the 2021 conference is "Building Resilient Food, Water and Energy Systems," which is particularly essential today, as the world grapples with a worldwide health and environmental crisis and its impact on vulnerable communities around the world. To improve systems and make them more resilient, we need to mitigate risks, partner collaboratively and consider the holistic implications of new technologies related to food, water and energy systems and their related support services. This learning event will promote new approaches, innovations and thought leadership that will allow us to find long-term solutions to address growing demands for food, water and energy in developing countries. This conference will facilitate open discussions of the roles of the public and private sectors, as well as civil society, in improving systems in a way that makes them more resilient, affordable and adaptable over time. Thus, the conference will bring together development practitioners and relevant stakeholders to discuss innovative ways to support these systems.
