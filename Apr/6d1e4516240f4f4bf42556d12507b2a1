Here at Agrilinks, we are continuously striving to give our audience an engaging and informative webinar experience. We have listened to your feedback and he ard your concerns, which is why we are switching to the BlueJeans webinar platform! We will continue to deliver the same quality content you are used to, with an improved user experience. As we celebrate the 10 year anniversary of Agrilinks, we will be hosting our first webinar on the new platform later this month. The switch to the BlueJeans platform is part of the continuing evolution of Agrilinks. We encourage you to check out this resource on how to join an event as an attendee on BlueJeans and learn about the functionalities that will be available to you as an attendee. You can also view aÂ slide deck on how to use the BlueJeans platform, for additional information. If you have any questions or concerns about our switch to BlueJeans, please feel free to reach out to me at adam.ahmed@bixal.com. We look forward to seeing you at our next Agrilinks event!
