Since 2016, the Food Safety Network (FSN), a partnership between USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has provided developing countries with the tools and training to reach international standards for agricultural trade.  This sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) regulatory capacity building supports the U.S. Government Global Food Security Strategy’s goals of improving food security, reducing poverty, and reducing malnutrition. The Foreign Agricultural Service joined with Texas A&M University, the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), FDA, the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS), and USAID to develop a suite of online training courses. This past March, FSN launched its 16th distance learning module with the goal of teaching how to apply science-based risk analysis concepts to analyze food safety challenges, as well as meet SPS Agreement obligations. During food safety month, FSN is releasing an eight-part blog series on different technical topics from the Food Safety Distance Learning Module. Below are the topics: Want to learn more about concepts within food safety?
