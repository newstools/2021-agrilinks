As part of the Agrilinks 10-year anniversary, we are celebrating with testimonials from some of our top users. Read on to hear from Muhammad Nurul Amin Siddiquee, the chief of party for the Feed the Future Bangladesh Livestock Production for Improved Nutrition and Agricultural Cooperative Development International/Volunteers in Overseas Cooperative Assistance (ACDI/VOCA) Country Representative in Bangladesh. The following is a transcript of a 10-year anniversary video series, the full video can be played at the bottom of the page. Hi, my name is Nurul Siddiquee, and I’ve been working in sustainable agriculture and food security programs over the past 15 years. I’ve been following Agrilinks very closely since its beginning. If you are someone who’s looking for an ideal platform to share your agriculture-related innovations and approaches, Agrilinks is the right place for you to follow. You can also learn a lot through this rich sharing of experiences from the developing communities through this platform. We are going through some of the largest challenges. Even though we have made a lot of progress in agriculture, there is still a lot of challenges for sustainable agriculture as we see a significant decrease in agriculture productive land as well as women’s role in agriculture. We are seeing youth as a potential resource in agriculture, but still, there is a lot to do to encourage this new entry into the industry. During COVID we have seen a lot of potential for [information and communication technology] (ICT) -led innovations in agriculture. However, for women-led small businesses and processors who are working in the space, there is a lot of challenge to access technology and to utilize technology in their day-to-day work. If I were to describe Agrilinks in one word, it would be mangrove — because of its interconnectedness in the way it engages the wider development community through research and networks. Happy 10-year anniversary, Agrilinks!
