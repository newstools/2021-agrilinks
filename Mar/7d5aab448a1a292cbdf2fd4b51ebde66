Nutrition programs tend to focus on mothers and overlook how other family members influence nutrition and caregiving during pregnancy and early childhood. There is considerable evidence that other family members, particularly fathers and grandmothers, have significant influence on food access, intrahousehold distribution of food, child feeding and, ultimately, over maternal nutrition and infant and young child feeding practices. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Advancing Nutrition seeks to understand global programmatic experiences engaging family members in addition to mothers (such as grandmothers, fathers and others) to improve maternal, child and adolescent nutrition through an online survey. This survey follows literature reviews of interventions that engaged family members to improve nutrition and a webinar on the same topic. The goal is to understand and document the diverse program experiences not fully captured in the published literature. The survey should take around 20 minutes to complete, and you will have the option to save your responses and return later. All responses are requested by March 29, 2021. Your responses to the survey questions will be confidential, but if you are willing to share specific reports or other materials about your activities, there will be a place to share them. If you have any questions about the survey, please contact Kate Litvin, technical specialist on nutrition and gender, USAID Advancing Nutrition, at kate_litvin@jsi.com.
