The new Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Horticulture has been posted to grants.gov and can be found here. The closing date for applications is May 11, 2021. The purpose of the Horticulture Innovation Lab (IL) is to identify and strengthen opportunities for smallholder farmers to develop and sustainably manage horticulture based enterprises in Feed the Future production systems, including research and local capacity development on 1) climate-resilient management of nutrient dense food and 20 inclusive horticultural business grown and commercialization, with focus on youth opportunity, gender equality and women’s empowerment. The objective of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to procure a Management Entity (ME) to manage the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Horticulture. Horticulture IL’s overarching goal, in line with the GFSS, is to reduce global hunger, malnutrition and poverty through science, technology and innovation. Horticulture IL will contribute to GFSS objectives to realize inclusive and sustainable agriculture-led economic growth, strengthened resilience among people and systems, and a well-nourished population, especially among youth, women, and young children. The Horticulture IL will build on USAID’s prior investments, including the previous Horticulture IL and its precursor Collaborative Research Support Program (CRSP). The Horticulture IL will function as a five-year Leader with Associates (LWA) Cooperative Agreement, awarded to an eligible U.S. university to develop a global portfolio of horticulture research-for-development.
