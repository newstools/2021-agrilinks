The Feed the Future Somalia Camel Leasing to Impact Resilience Activity is a two-year, USAID-funded research study that explores the practice of camel leasing and its potential to increase the resilience of Somali pastoralist households, communities and camel milk processors in the face of severe droughts or other climate-related shocks or stresses. The research team is engaging key stakeholders through a series of surveys, focus groups and interviews, as well as through a camel milk value chain analysis, to determine how the practice of camel leasing is affecting the lives and businesses of camel pastoralists and milk processors. Over the last year, the Somalia Camel Leasing to Impact Resilience Activity has generated significant interest across a wide array of audiences: Somali pastoralists and dairy owners, livestock specialists, resilience experts, international development practitioners and others. While the term “camel leasing” itself is enough to pique people’s interest, most people are unaware of the genesis and practices behind camel leasing. To help explain camel leasing and its perceived benefits, the research team has developed a brief explainer video which breaks the practice down into its simplest parts. Watch the video below, and don’t forget to keep an eye out for updates about the research as we move into our second phase.
